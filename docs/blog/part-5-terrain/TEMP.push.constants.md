## Push Constants

### Overview

We next introduce _push constants_ as an alternative and more efficient means of updating the view matrices.

Push constants are used to send data to shaders with some constraints:

* The maximum amount of data is usually relatively small (specified by the `maxPushConstantsSize` of the `VkPhysicalDeviceLimits` structure).

* Push constants are updated and stored within the command buffer itself.

* Push constants have alignment restrictions, see [vkCmdPushConstants](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/vkCmdPushConstants.html).

### Push Constant Range

We start with a _push constant range_ which specifies a portion of the push constants and the shader stages where that data is used:

```java
public record PushConstantRange(int offset, int size, Set<VkShaderStage> stages) {
    public int length() {
        return offset + size;
    }

    void populate(VkPushConstantRange range) {
        range.stageFlags = IntegerEnumeration.mask(stages);
        range.size = size;
        range.offset = offset;
    }
}
```

The _offset_ and _size_ of a push constant range must be a multiple of four bytes which is validated in the constructor:

```java
public PushConstantRange {
    ...
    validate(offset);
    validate(size);
}

static void validate(int size) {
    if((size % 4) != 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException(...);
}
```

The builder for the pipeline layout is modified to include a list of push constant ranges:

```java
public static class Builder {
    ...
    private final List<PushConstantRange> ranges = new ArrayList<>();

    public Builder add(PushConstantRange range) {
        ranges.add(range);
        return this;
    }
}
```

The ranges are populated in the usual manner:

```java
public PipelineLayout build(DeviceContext dev) {
    ...
    info.pushConstantRangeCount = ranges.size();
    info.pPushConstantRanges = StructureHelper.first(ranges, VkPushConstantRange::new, PushConstantRange::populate);
    ...
}
```

Note that multiple ranges can be specified which allows the application to update some or all of the push constants at different shader stages and also enables the hardware to perform optimisations.

In the `build` method we also determine the overall size of the push constants and associated shaders stages (which are added to the pipeline layout constructor):

```java
// Determine overall size of the push constants data
int max = ranges
    .stream()
    .mapToInt(PushConstantRange::length)
    .max()
    .orElse(0);

// Check that overall size is supported by the hardware
if(max > dev.limits().maxPushConstantsSize) throw new IllegalArgumentException(...);

// Enumerate pipeline stages
Set<VkShaderStage> stages = ranges
    .stream()
    .map(PushConstantRange::stages)
    .flatMap(Set::stream)
    .collect(toSet());

// Create layout
return new PipelineLayout(layout.getValue(), dev, max, stages);
```

Note that the size of the data buffer is validated against the hardware limit which is often quite small (256 bytes on the development environment).

These new properties are also used to validate the push constant update command which is addressed next.

### Update Command


Push constants are backed by a data buffer updated using a new command:

```java
public class PushConstantUpdateCommand implements Command {
    private final PipelineLayout layout;
    private final int offset;
    private final ByteBuffer data;
    private final int stages;

    @Override
    public void execute(VulkanLibrary lib, Buffer buffer) {
        data.rewind();
        lib.vkCmdPushConstants(buffer, layout, stages, offset, data.limit(), data);
    }
}
```

Notes:

* The data buffer is rewound before updates are applied, generally Vulkan seems to automatically rewind buffers as required (e.g. for updating the uniform buffer) but not in this case.

* The constructor applies validation (not shown) to verify alignments, buffer sizes, etc.

The new API method is added to the library for the pipeline layout:

```java
void vkCmdPushConstants(Buffer commandBuffer, PipelineLayout layout, int stageFlags, int offset, int size, ByteBuffer pValues);
```

The constructor is public but we also provide a builder:

```java
public static class Builder {
    private int offset;
    private ByteBuffer data;
    private final Set<VkShaderStage> stages = new HashSet<>();

    ...
    
    public PushConstantUpdateCommand build(PipelineLayout layout) {
        return new PushConstantUpdateCommand(layout, offset, data, stages);
    }
}
```

We provide builder methods to update all the push constants or an arbitrary _slice_ of the backing data buffer:

```java
public Builder data(ByteBuffer data, int offset, int size) {
    this.data = data.slice(offset, size);
    return this;
}
```

And the following convenience method to update a slice specified by a corresponding range:

```java
public Builder data(ByteBuffer data, PushConstantRange range) {
    return data(data, range.offset(), range.size());
}
```

Finally we add a convenience factory method to create a backing buffer appropriate to the pipeline layout:

```java
public static ByteBuffer data(PipelineLayout layout) {
    return BufferHelper.allocate(layout.max());
}
```

And a second helper to update the entire buffer:

```java
public static PushConstantUpdateCommand of(PipelineLayout layout) {
    ByteBuffer data = data(layout);
    return new PushConstantUpdateCommand(layout, 0, data, layout.stages());
}
```

### Integration

To use the push constants in the demo application the uniform buffer is first replaced with the following layout declaration in the vertex shader:

```glsl
layout(push_constant) uniform Matrices {
    mat4 model;
    mat4 view;
    mat4 projection;
};
```

In the pipeline configuration we remove the uniform buffer and replace it with a single push constant range sized to the three matrices:

```java
@Bean
PipelineLayout layout(DescriptorLayout layout) {
    int len = 3 * Matrix.IDENTITY.length();

    return new PipelineLayout.Builder()
        .add(layout)
        .add(new PushConstantRange(0, len, Set.of(VkShaderStage.VERTEX)))
        .build(dev);
}
```

Next we create a command to update the whole of the push constants buffer:

```java
@Bean
public static PushUpdateCommand update(PipelineLayout layout) {
    return PushUpdateCommand.of(layout);
}
```

In the camera configuration the push constants are updated once per frame:

```java
@Bean
public Task matrix(PushUpdateCommand update) {
    ByteBuffer data = update.data();
    return () -> {
        data.rewind();
        Matrix.IDENTITY.buffer(data);
        cam.matrix().buffer(data);
        projection.buffer(data);
    };
}
```

Finally the update command is added to the render sequence before starting the render pass.
