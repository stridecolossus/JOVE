demo
- skydome
- instancing, cubes then tree model
- lighting, materials
- solar system, scene graph
- geometry shader, normals, bounding volumes (spheres as x2 circles)
- galaxy demo using point cloud

scene
- is Ray.Intersection what we actually need? would need ray + volume in intersection record to be useful in stream processing?
- composite object for near/far plane distances, FOV, projection matrix, i.e. stuff used in scene? or Scene object?
- scene = n/f, FOV, root node, projection, viewport, camera
- scene nodes - tree, node = transform, renderable object, material (shader) + properties (UBO, push constants)
- how do descriptor sets fit here? part of material?
- visitor, generates nodes to render (occlusion, volumes), opaque/translucent/skybox render queues
- world and local transforms? visitor to update
- node inheritance? e.g. transform change propagates up, volume change down, etc?
- should volumes enforce intersect(sphere) and intersect(extents)? or ABC? or leave as-is? should frustum really be a volume?

sphere builder

- https://lindenreid.wordpress.com/2017/12/03/simple-mesh-tessellation-triangulation-tutorial/
- sphere/conic builder, uses unit circle, add pole, add ring with N points / segment
- extrusion, creates 'cylinder' from 2D shape + normal + dist (segment) from previous, iterative

other possible features
- texture fonts, atlas based, or TT font -> builder, 3D, etc
- OpenAL audio
- shader storage buffer (SSBO)

features todo
- custom application properties? using Jackson, or SnakeYAML, JSON, etc
- screenshots, how? render to off-screen attachment?
- degenerate triangles for strip?

blog
- pipeline cache
- check out old blog
- index of VK/JOVE objects by chapter

framework
- re-build swapchain and pipeline after window viewport/focus change

improvements
- pipeline cache could use Java prefs? and/or user home folder?
- interpolator revamp
- joystick from desktop service
- code gen type mapper sucks, should be declarative but not using nasty switches? table driven somehow (we already have the table!), functional?
- manually fiddled by-reference for pointer-to-array of structure
