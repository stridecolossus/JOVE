indexed model
- can we use some sort of bulk collections operation rather than iteratively testing each vertex? would we want to?

pipeline
- nasty base-classes, initialisation, result() method, etc. Can we make these just builders somehow?

volumes
- introduce abstract impl
- no point in records for impls -> class
- SphereVolume composes a Sphere + centre
- Extents = volume?
- or BoundingVolume.of(Extents)
- no need for 3 intersects() methods, just make it use instanceof
- compound should defensive copy
- integrate Sphere helper and UnitCircle and Matrix.rotation()?
- Extents also should not be a record
- BoundingBox === Extents? no need for final
- Frustum should have a builder!
- Frustum remove reflection tostring
