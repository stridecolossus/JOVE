indexed model
- can we use some sort of bulk collections operation rather than iteratively testing each vertex? would we want to?

pipeline
- nasty base-classes, initialisation, result() method, etc. Can we make these just builders somehow?
- caching

volumes
- integrate Sphere helper and UnitCircle and Matrix.rotation()?
- Frustum should have a builder!
- Frustum remove reflection tostring

demo
- skybox, cube map

other
- layouts of components as annotations? does this buy us anything?
- component-wise bi/operator support for tuple/vector/point, e.g. matrix set row/column, AABB-Ray intersect, extents operators

matrix
- private implementations for 2/3/4 order matrices? move order to constant? => ABC, but can remove order field (accessor is never used)

blog
- back to front? should start with desired outcome (demo, tests) and then describe implementation? e.g. render pass builder THEN the sub builders, etc.
