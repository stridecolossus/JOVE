**********

generator for primitive arrays -> need to be handles?

VkShaderModuleCreateInfo::pCode
VkSubmitInfo::pWaitDstStageMask
VkSpecializationInfo::pData

also injects superfluous padding

**********

mesh loader still needs custom indexed implementation

consider physical device + queue family pair, convenience record -> selectors, vulkan surface

add debug support for the create instance call
https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Drawing_a_triangle/Setup/Validation_layers

diagnostics handler:
integrate with callback stuff (or too complicated? esp since returns structures, enums, etc)
update blog? i.e. dumps messages to console by default
VkDebugUtilsMessengerCallbackDataEXT
3 x returned arrays -> unsupported!
call back is OK but structure cannot be unmarshalled

README.md
- summary
- link to blog

devices are public - could lead to multiple binds for same callback-listener! => enforce max one per window?

MemorySegment -> supported transformer type?
- IdentityTransformer
- @Updated replaces Pointer?
- only IntegerReference is special case
- use Handle only for immutable parameters
- makes TypeMapper much simpler???

-------------------------------

demo
- skydome
- lighting, materials
- solar system

scene
- composite object for near/far plane distances, FOV, projection matrix, i.e. stuff used in scene? or Scene object?
- node inheritance? e.g. transform change propagates up, volume change down, etc?
- should volumes enforce intersect(sphere) and intersect(extents)? or ABC? or leave as-is? should frustum really be a volume?

sphere builder

- https://lindenreid.wordpress.com/2017/12/03/simple-mesh-tessellation-triangulation-tutorial/
- sphere/conic builder, uses unit circle, add pole, add ring with N points / segment
- extrusion, creates 'cylinder' from 2D shape + normal + dist (segment) from previous, iterative

text
- atlas?
- TT fonts?
- per character?
- or render using Java text -> draw to Java image -> VK image? 
- https://snorristurluson.github.io/TextRenderingWithFreetype/

features todo
- enhance Work to chain sequences + sync, e.g. for loading a texture, Q - use semaphores, or fence for each step, both?
- custom application properties? using Jackson, or SnakeYAML, JSON, etc
- degenerate triangles for strip?
- normals via geometry shader
- mesh shader
- dynamic descriptors sets and uniform buffers (?)
- OpenAL streaming audio (queue) https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft/wiki/Programmer%27s-Guide#queuing-buffers-on-a-source
- memory region rounding if not host coherent

improvements
- pipeline cache could use Java prefs? and/or user home folder?
- interpolator revamp
- joystick from desktop service

particles
- particle class ~ use case? position, timestamp(?), colour, size?
- or similar to vertex?
- start/end size => vertex attribute
- low/high fade, when particles start to fade, high = lifetime
- storage buffer, for whole scenes (!) or particles in compute pipeline, https://vkguide.dev/docs/chapter-4/storage_buffers/
