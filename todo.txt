indexed model
- can we use some sort of bulk collections operation rather than iteratively testing each vertex? would we want to?

pipeline
- nasty base-classes, initialisation, result() method, etc. Can we make these just builders somehow?
- caching

volumes
- integrate Sphere helper and UnitCircle and Matrix.rotation()?
- Frustum should have a builder!
- Frustum remove reflection tostring

demo
- skybox, cube map

other
- layouts of components as annotations? does this buy us anything?
- component-wise bi/operator support for tuple/vector/point, e.g. matrix set row/column, AABB-Ray intersect, extents operators
- Dimension.exceeds() rotten name
- extents builder -> collector?
