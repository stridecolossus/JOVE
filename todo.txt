demo
- skydome
- instancing, cubes then tree model
- lighting, materials
- solar system

scene
- composite object for near/far plane distances, FOV, projection matrix, i.e. stuff used in scene? or Scene object?
- node inheritance? e.g. transform change propagates up, volume change down, etc?
- should volumes enforce intersect(sphere) and intersect(extents)? or ABC? or leave as-is? should frustum really be a volume?

sphere builder

- https://lindenreid.wordpress.com/2017/12/03/simple-mesh-tessellation-triangulation-tutorial/
- sphere/conic builder, uses unit circle, add pole, add ring with N points / segment
- extrusion, creates 'cylinder' from 2D shape + normal + dist (segment) from previous, iterative

text
- atlas?
- TT fonts?
- per character?
- or render using Java text -> draw to Java image -> VK image? 
- https://snorristurluson.github.io/TextRenderingWithFreetype/

features todo
- enhance Work to chain sequences + sync, e.g. for loading a texture, Q - use semaphores, or fence for each step, both?
- custom application properties? using Jackson, or SnakeYAML, JSON, etc
- degenerate triangles for strip?
- re-build swapchain and pipeline after window viewport/focus change
- normals via geometry shader
- mesh shader
- dynamic descriptors sets and uniform buffers (?)
- OpenAL streaming audio (queue)

blog
- pipeline cache
- check out old blog

improvements
- pipeline cache could use Java prefs? and/or user home folder?
- interpolator revamp
- joystick from desktop service
- code gen type mapper sucks, should be declarative but not using nasty switches? table driven somehow (we already have the table!), functional?
- vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties? to check attachment format vs layouts
- attachment image stereotypes? why pass layout into subpass? why separate methods to add colour/depth?

particles
- particle class ~ use case? position, timestamp(?), colour, size?
- or similar to vertex?
- start/end size => vertex attribute
- low/high fade, when particles start to fade, high = lifetime
- storage buffer for particles in compute pipeline
