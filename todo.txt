pipeline
- re-build pipeline after window viewport/focus change
- check for depth attachment in frame-buffer::create

model
- sphere/conic builder, uses unit circle, add pole, add ring with N points / segment
- extrusion, creates 'cylinder' from 2D shape + normal + dist (segment) from previous, iterative

demo
- skybox, cube map, skydome?
- instancing, cubes then tree model, multiple models per OBJ? names? => materials?
- lighting, materials
- solar system, scene graph
- terrain rendering, tiled, LOD, tesselation shader, loader from gray-scale, oct-tree?
- geometry shader, normals, bounding volumes (spheres as x2 circles)

core
- DeviceFeatures - tests/annotations for required features? techniques -> materials ~ available features

scene
- is Ray.Intersection what we actually need? would need ray + volume in intersection record to be useful in stream processing?
- composite object for near/far plane distances, FOV, projection matrix, i.e. stuff used in scene? or Scene object?
- scene = n/f, FOV, root node, projection, viewport, camera
- scene nodes - tree, node = transform, renderable object, material (shader) + properties (UBO, push constants)
- how do descriptor sets fit here? part of material?
- visitor, generates nodes to render (occlusion, volumes), opaque/translucent/skybox render queues
- world and local transforms? visitor to update
- node inheritance? e.g. transform change propagates up, volume change down, etc?
- should volumes enforce intersect(sphere) and intersect(extents)? or ABC? or leave as-is? should frustum really be a volume?

- https://lindenreid.wordpress.com/2017/12/03/simple-mesh-tessellation-triangulation-tutorial/
- mesh builder?
- strip builder? should be some sort of collector that operates on a collection of vertices -> strip (?) + index? or factory method that generates vertices from triangle/index?
- add degenerate triangle

other features
- texture fonts?
- terrain grid from height-map
- OpenAL audio

current
- some sort of triangle builder? used in demo and to create x2 triangles for a quad
- acquire should create a frame object of some sort (swap chain is immutable), i.e. don't care about index

need to filter buttons by action/mods
