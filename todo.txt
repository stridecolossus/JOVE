**********
generator for primitive arrays -> need to be handles?
VkShaderModuleCreateInfo::pCode
VkSubmitInfo::pWaitDstStageMask
VkSpecializationInfo::pData
VkDebugUtilsMessengerCallbackDataEXT
also injects superfluous padding
**********

sort out transient/native release()

resize handler -> recreate swapchain
minimised window -> glfwGetFramebufferSize returns 0, glfwWaitEvents() pauses?

MSAA
- render target with > 1 samples, and rasterizer
- resolve attachment
- depth ditto
- usage: transient, colour
- final layout = colour optimal

blog
- move mesh load/persist -> model loader chapter
- check cube vertices in perspective.md
- physical device refers to NativeParameter
- add section for minimised/closed windows ~ callbacks, recreation
- region redundant after Panama, replaced with segment

what is an descriptor set array used for?
https://docs.vulkan.org/samples/latest/samples/performance/descriptor_management/README.html

mesh loader: 1. still needs custom indexed implementation, 2. nasty ByteBuffer fiddle when writing

interpolation expansion: colours, vector, quaternion, etc?

helper for 'wrappers' that are not native objects (i.e. not destroyed) but compose and optionally destroy their dependencies?
buffers - VBO, index, resource (uniform), flag on buffer itself, these classes replicate logic? default boolean autoRelease() ?
View - done

we would want to configure pipeline stage from YAML like files, fluid builder less important (?)

add debug support for the create instance call
https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Drawing_a_triangle/Setup/Validation_layers

diagnostics handler:
integrate with callback stuff (or too complicated? esp since returns structures, enums, etc)
update blog? i.e. dumps messages to console by default
VkDebugUtilsMessengerCallbackDataEXT
3 x returned arrays -> unsupported!
call back is OK but structure cannot be unmarshalled

- summary
- link to blog

MemorySegment -> supported transformer type?
- IdentityTransformer
- @Updated replaces Pointer?
- only IntegerReference is special case
- use Handle only for immutable parameters
- makes TypeMapper much simpler???

-------------------------------

demo
- skydome
- lighting, materials
- solar system

scene
- picking, rays, etc
- culling, frustum, custom (e.g. terrain blocks)
- lighting: light node? support for uniform -> shader, colour/position animation, etc
- composite object for near/far plane distances, FOV, projection matrix, i.e. stuff used in scene? or Scene object?
- node inheritance? e.g. transform change propagates up, volume change down, etc?
- should volumes enforce intersect(sphere) and intersect(extents)? or ABC? or leave as-is? should frustum really be a volume?

sphere builder

- http://in4k.untergrund.net/html_articles/hugi_27_-_coding_corner_polaris_sphere_tessellation_101.htm
- https://lindenreid.wordpress.com/2017/12/03/simple-mesh-tessellation-triangulation-tutorial/
- sphere/conic builder, uses unit circle, add pole, add ring with N points / segment
- extrusion, creates 'cylinder' from 2D shape + normal + dist (segment) from previous, iterative

text
- atlas?
- TT fonts?
- per character?
- or render using Java text -> draw to Java image -> VK image? 
- https://snorristurluson.github.io/TextRenderingWithFreetype/

features todo
- enhance Work to chain sequences + sync, e.g. for loading a texture, Q - use semaphores, or fence for each step, both?
- degenerate triangles for strip?
- normals via geometry shader
- mesh shader
- dynamic descriptors sets and uniform buffers (?)
- OpenAL streaming audio (queue) https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft/wiki/Programmer%27s-Guide#queuing-buffers-on-a-source
- memory region rounding if not host coherent

improvements
- pipeline cache could use Java prefs? and/or user home folder?
- joystick from desktop service

particles
- particle class ~ use case? position, timestamp(?), colour, size?
- or similar to vertex?
- start/end size => vertex attribute
- low/high fade, when particles start to fade, high = lifetime
- storage buffer, for whole scenes (!) or particles in compute pipeline, https://vkguide.dev/docs/chapter-4/storage_buffers/
